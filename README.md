Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, 
and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These 
tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, 
researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

You have been provided with a dataset called schools.csv, which is previewed below.

You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.
